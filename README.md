# c-fuzzy-extractor
A fuzzy extractor written in C, based on a Python implementation by C. Yagemann, who did all the heavy lifting. Please see his original implementation (with stellar documentation) at https://github.com/carter-yagemann/python-fuzzy-extractor

The underlying construction is based on Canetti et al. 2016 (Reusable Fuzzy Extractors for Low-Entropy Distributions). As such, this fuzzy extractor does not employ ECC, but rather relies on digital lockers.

I developed this tool in the course of my master thesis at FH Hagenberg, focusing on SRAM PUFs. I used it to demonstrate that low-cost authentication is possible with SRAM PUFs. Sadly, this fuzzy extractor, being based on digital lockers, produces a substantial amount of helper data. It produces so much helper data, in fact, that it becomes unusable with larger (i.e. realistically sized) SRAM fingerprints.

An improved approach to the digital locker fuzzy extractor exists: please see Cheon et al. 2018 (A Reusable Fuzzy Extractor with Practical Storage Size). Using their threshold method, one could reduce the size of helper data by over 98%.
